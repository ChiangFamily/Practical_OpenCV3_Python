[1]  DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project you will learn how you can automatically Localize, Segment, Detect and Recognize Number Plates of Cars
in an image or video Stream. The implementation of the project uses various concepts that we have learnt in the earlier sections.
While, the implementation of the system is not State of the Art system and not meant for production use-case, but covers 
the basics of building such systems in general. 

This implementation assuems no ground truth for detecting the number plates, but we can improve accuracy by have knowledge of the 
country and the font size used the plates and improve the accuracy.

[2]  SETUP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is written in Python3 and uses the OpenCV3 Libary.

Dependencies:
        1. Python 3
        2. OpenCV 3
        3. OpenCV3 contrib Library 
        4. Numpy

Softwares:
        1. Docker (optional)
        

> Method 1 : Using Local System

Please use build.sh for ( Mac / Linux ) and build.bat for Windows.
Note: This method creates a python virtualenv, to create a independent 
environment that runs all the projects, no additional setup needed.

> Method 2 : Using Docker

Please install docker and find the "Dockerfile" in the main repository for setting up the 
development environment. 
 
If you are new to docker please refer https://docs.docker.com/


[3]  TEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the environment is set successfully.

Clone the Project:

>git clone http://github.com/riaz/Section2_NumberPlateRecognition
